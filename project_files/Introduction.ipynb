Even though there’s been a continues decrease in serious injuries on the Seattle Streets, there’s still a long way to go to reach the city’s goal of zero traffic fatalities and serious injuries by 2030. Not all traffic accidents lead to injury however, and some result in property damage only. It could be of valuable information if one could identify the relevance of different factors surrounding a traffic accident and use these to predict whether a traffic accident will result in injury or property damage.</b></p>"

Road users could use this information to make assumptions on when and where to be extra cautious, and which routes are more exposed than others and should be avoided at certain times or when certain conditions are meet. The emergency services could allocate their resources and adapt their preparedness with this information as a reference point.
